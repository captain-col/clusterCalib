Define the constant runtime parameters.  These are the parameters that
should not be looked up from a database.

Define the time per digit in the TPulseDigit.  This specifies the minimum
and is used to calculate the number of bins in the FFT.

< clusterCalib.digitization.step = 250 ns >

Define the maximum length of a pulse.  The exact value isn't important, but
should be considerably longer than a pulse.

< clusterCalib.digitization.pulse = 100000 ns >

Define the maximum length of the impulse response function.

< clusterCalib.digitization.response = 100000 ns >
